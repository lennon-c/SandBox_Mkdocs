Playground for testing options, plugins, formatting of:

- mkdocs
- mkdocs-material 
- mkdocstrings-python
- markdown-exec[ansi]
- mkdocs-open-in-new-tab
- mkdocs-callouts (disabled, used to allow Obsidian syntax for callouts)

Just a set of personal tests, to see what works and what does not. 

Showcased in this project's [documentation](https://lennon-c.github.io/SandBox_Mkdocs/)
