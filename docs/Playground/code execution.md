This can be used either for automating (just executing without showing source code) or in tutorials (executing and showing both the results and the source code).


This requires installing `markdown-exec`. [See the documentation](https://pawamoy.github.io/markdown-exec/usage/)


## Showing source code and results
###  tabbed
```python exec="true" source="tabbed-left" result="pycon"
import os, sys 
print('cwd',os.getcwd())

for path in sys.path:
    print(path)
```
which was generated by using the markdown code: 

````markdown  
```python exec="true" source="tabbed-left" result="pycon"
import os, sys 
print('cwd',os.getcwd())

for path in sys.path:
    print(path)
```
````

### source code above

```python exec="true" source="above" result="pycon"
import os
print(os.getcwd())
```

which was run by using: 
````md
```python exec="true" source="above" result="pycon"
import os
print(os.getcwd())
```
````

## running own hosted module in GitHub
This is really cool, one can use `markdown-exec` to showcase own projects that are hosted in GitHub. Or to insert examples in the docstrings as for class [`Two_numbers`][sandbox.calculations.Two_numbers]


Here, a python script importing a class from this project module `sandbox.calculations.Two_numbers`.

```python exec="true" source="tabbed-left" result="pycon"  
from sandbox.calculations import Two_numbers

nums = Two_numbers(4, 2)
print(f'{nums.add()=}')
```

which was run using this markdown code:

````md
```python exec="true" source="tabbed-left" result="pycon"  
from sandbox.calculations import Two_numbers

nums = Two_numbers(4, 2)
print(f'{nums.add()=}')
```
````
### Using `mkdocs gh-deploy` manually

With poetry, this work out of the box.
No tested without poetry, probably you will need to install the package in the environment first. 

### Using GitHub actions

My first trial working with GitHub actions did only work  partially:

- It was actually working for development `mkdocs serve`, but not in production.

Solution:

-  I modified the `ci.yml` file for GitHub workflows, so that my package can be installed at deployment. Adding this line:

```yml title="ci.yml"
    - run: pip install git+https://github.com/lennon-c/SandBox_Mkdocs.git
```

- Since it requires an install, one has to setup the source code as a package.
    - I am using poetry, so I just had to make sure to add the required documentation for packaging, but there was no need for a package wheel! 



## Prints 

Sadly, it cannot capture prints from imported code
Nothing will be printed in the following two blocks.

```python exec="true" source="tabbed-left" result="pycon"
from sandbox.prints import Printer 
printer = Printer()
printer.print_me()
```

```python exec="1" source="tabbed-left" result="pycon"
from sandbox.prints import function_print
function_print()
```

It is only able to see prints from functions created in the current session. 

```python exec="1" source="tabbed-left" result="pycon"
def print_from_script():
    print("print from the script")

print_from_script()
```
