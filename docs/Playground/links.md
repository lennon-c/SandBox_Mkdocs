Linking things can be tricky

Inserting a link to a docstring element:

link to class `sandbox.calculations.Two_numbers`

This does not work on development `mkdocs serve`
[link to class]('/SandBox_Mkdocs/API/calculations/#sandbox.calculations.Two_numbers')

```md 
[link to class]('/SandBox_Mkdocs/API/calculations/#sandbox.calculations.Two_numbers')
```
